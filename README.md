Sistem Tiga Dua is a single-player, isometric three-dimensional hack-and-slash video game set in the Tron-inspired digital world of Jendela. Players will assume the role of Mai, a university student who has to save the digital world of Jendela and its citizens from enemies. The video game takes inspiration from other popular hack-and-slash video games, such as _Devil May Cry 5_, _Nier: Automata_, _Honkai Impact 3rd_, and _Hades_.

Sistem Tiga Dua is still in development. Screenshots are taken from the v0.5.0-alpha build.
